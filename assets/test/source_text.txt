Hello, I would like you to touch wood. Do you know this expression? The easiest way to understand it is referring to the heatwave of 2003 we have well known, may be more in the countryside with agricultural production. In 2003 I did not harvest at all. When we see this as a farmer one has the right to wonder about the future. That's why I brought you wood that I will distribute.
